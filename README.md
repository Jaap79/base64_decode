# base64_decode
Just a small script to decode Base64 strings in a variety of charactersets

# What does it do
The tool, runnable through Python, will ask for a base64-encoded string. Enter the code and the script will decode the message using a variety of character sets (UTF, Big5, ASCII, shift_Jis, GBK, EUC-CN, ISO-8859 etc).
Use at your own leisure. I'm just trying to see how this works.
